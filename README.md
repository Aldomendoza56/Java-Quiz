# JavaScript-Quiz
In this assingment we were to create a quiz with a timer. This particular assignment was a little more challenging than the previous assignments mainly because there were a lot of moving parts that needed to come together. In the end the challenge showed me that I need to put in little more effort when it comes to JavaScript and Web APIs. Anyways in this challenge the quiz asks simple questions that are pretty straight forward but the quiz has timer that is counting down. When you get an answer wrong the timer depletes by 15 seconds and if you do manage to finish the quiz the score is stored in local Storage and on the highscore's page. I know the CSS wasn't a main focus on this particular challenge but I did try my best to make the application appealing and attractive for the user.
